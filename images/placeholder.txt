This is a placeholder file for the images directory.

In a real implementation, this directory would contain image files such as:
- hero-bg.jpg (for the hero section background)
- about-school.jpg (for the about page)
- news1.jpg, news2.jpg, news3.jpg (for news items)
- classroom.jpg, lab.jpg, library.jpg, etc. (for facilities)
- principal.jpg, vice-principal.jpg, etc. (for administration)
- teacher profile images
- activity images
- gallery images

These images would need to be added to complete the website.
